Solar System Simulation 🌌
An interactive simulation of the Solar System written in Python.

🧭 Overview
This project simulates the movement of the Sun and planets in the Solar System using Python. It provides a visual and interactive way to learn about planetary orbits and rotations.

Planets orbit the Sun and rotate around their axes

Realistic orbits and speeds (with some simplifications for clarity)

Interactive controls (zoom, pan, pause, etc. if available)

Educational and illustrative, not for scientific calculations

🔧 Technologies
Python 3.13

[pygame / matplotlib / tkinter / vpython / turtle]

Standard Python libraries

🚀 Getting Started
Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/SirRadek/Solar_system_simulation.git
cd Solar_system_simulation
Install dependencies:
(Replace requirements.txt if you have one, or list libraries explicitly.)

pip install -r requirements.txt
or, for example:

pip install pygame

Run the simulation:

python main.py

🎮 Controls

Action	How to Use
Zoom in/out	Mouse wheel / +/- keys (if implemented)
Pan/Rotate view	Click and drag / arrow keys (if implemented)
Pause/Resume	Spacebar or dedicated button
Reset view	R key or menu

Update according to your app’s actual controls.

🎨 Data Sources & Credits

Orbital and size data: NASA, Wikipedia

Inspired by open-source solar system visualizations

🛠️ Possible Improvements
Add asteroids or comets

Improve physics for more realism (e.g., elliptical orbits, inclination)

Add UI for speed, scale, or info panels

Export data or screenshots
